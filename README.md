üöï Taxi Run Sheet PDF Data Extractor

This is a Streamlit web application designed to extract structured trip data (Pickups, Dropoffs, Customer IDs, and Comments) from highly complex, tabular PDF run sheets generated by a transportation scheduling system.

The application leverages the pdfplumber library for robust table extraction, paired with advanced custom logic to handle common PDF parsing issues, such such as merged cells, sparse drop-off rows, and inconsistent column alignment.

‚ú® Features

High Accuracy Extraction: Achieves a near 100% data completion rate on tested run sheet formats.

Robustness: Combines table detection with custom persistence logic (FIFO matching) to correctly pair pickups with subsequent sequential drop-offs.

Clean Formatting: Standardizes abbreviations, prefixes numbers with 'Nb:', and shortens comment headers for clean data import into systems like Icabi.

Cache Management: Includes an "Upload New File" button to instantly clear the Streamlit cache and process a new PDF without restarting the application.
